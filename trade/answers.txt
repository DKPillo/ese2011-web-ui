1. Explain how a typical HTTP request is processed with the framework (the request lifecycle)
HTTP-request to HAML-Form, starting SINATRA-request, using RUBY-code, delivering information to SINATRA adding to HAML-Form, rendering HTTP-Site

2. Why should GET requests be indempotent?
Idea of idempotent: if you do the same command twice (or multiple times), it's as if you'd have it done only once. GET requests should be idempotent; otherwise you could get the same information twice and get different states of said information while further processing.

3. Where should you format data for rendering?
Data for rendering should be formated as soon as possible to minimize errors (Ruby-Code).
